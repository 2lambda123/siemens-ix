Panes are interactive components that allow users to access hidden content or options that are not visible on the screen. 

It can help users to focus better on their tasks since related controls are visually grouped and the main content contains less information. They are beneficial to use for more compact and hierarchically better organized content, providing a more dynamic layout. You can use them to give contextual information or providing a more tidied up main content for your users for a better task focus.

1. Left pane 
2. Top pane
3. Bottom pane
4. Right pane 

## Options

- **Title**: On the top left to better organize the panels, the user can use an optional icon that can be shown before the title. when the user collapses the inline pane, the title also becomes smaller and is displayed on the left side.
- **Icon**: An Icon can be displayed with the title on the header.
- **Size**: Use one of the following values for the height of a left or right pane, and for the width of a top or bottom pane (on mobile, panes will always be full screen):
	- `240px`
	- `320px`
	- `360px`
	- `480px`
	- `33%`
	- `100%`
- **Buttons**: The floating panes the options to close on the right side, and the inline pane user can expand and collapse the pane with the back and forth button. 
- **Borders**: Can be applied to separate different sections or elements within the same pane, otherwise, you can set all panes without a border for a minimalist and smooth visual experience.
- **Floating**: The panes are shown next to each other and can change in size depending on the available space. The main content remains in its position at the top and doesn't move. In the same time up to four pane can be active. 
	- **Inline**: They move the main content. The panes are displayed horizontally in a flexible manner but not for top and bottom. The right and the left pane compressed the main body. 

## Behavior 

- **Responsive**: Make the usage suitable for desktop version and adjusts its panes according to the  breakpoints, suitable for small and large screens. 
- **Layout**: There are two layouts, one on the left and right pane, the other on the top and bottom pane. If the right and left pane expands, the top and bottom pane will be compressed, the pane is above the main body content.   
	- **Width**: For the top and bottom panes default 100% available, for the left and right panes is maximum 50% available from the whole screen. For mobile version the panes takes the whole 100% from the screen.
	- **Height**: For the left and right panes default 100% available space, for the top and bottom panes is maximum 50% available from the white space. For mobile always takes 100% from the screen.
