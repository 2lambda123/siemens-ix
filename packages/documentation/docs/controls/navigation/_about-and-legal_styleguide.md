title: About and legal overlay
---

The About and legal component is an overlay which we typically use to show application information, application versions, license terms, legal regulations, copyright information and other legal related content. It appears when users click on the "About and legal" icon (1) and overlays the current content. Closing this overlay brings users back to the original content.

- (1) Info icon to open and close the About and legal overlay
- (2) Replaceable content header with the default string "About & legal information"
- (3) Close button to close the overlay
- (4) Tabs (optional) to navigate through multiple content categories
- (5) Content dependent on your app and local legal regulations (Figma design is not binding, only a proposal)

## Behavior
Overlay opens on top of application content with a semi-transparent background with a background blur effect to emphasize the overlay character. Closing this overlay brings back users to the previous content.  
The overlay can be closed in three ways:
- Select the close button
- Click the info icon again
- Click another navigation item
