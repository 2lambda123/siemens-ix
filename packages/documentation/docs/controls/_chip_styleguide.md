Chips are compact, interactive elements commonly used in user interfaces to represent information, choices, or actions in a concise format. They are versatile components that provide a visual and often interactive representation of data, such as tags, labels, or selections and are widely employed for content organization, categorization, and user interaction.

**Usage:** Chips offer users the ability to input data, make choices, fine-tune content searches, and initiate actions. In contrast to buttons, which are expected to have a consistent appearance and familiar action labels, chips are intended to dynamically appear as a cluster of multiple interactive elements.

4. Trailing remove icon (optional, input & filter chips only) 


## Variants
(Chip variants help maintain clarity and consistency in design.)?? By using predefined chips for specific purposes (e.g., success, warning, error,alarm, critical, custom, neutral), designers ensure that users can quickly and intuitively understand the meaning of visual elements. They provide guidance on how to interact with a system or understand the information being presented. For example, a "success" chip indicates that a task has been completed successfully.

 ## Behaviour 

- **Editable:** editable chips provide users with the ability to modify the content within the chip, such as tags, labels, or input values. 

- **Interaction:** is a fundamental aspect of modern user interfaces, making it easier for users to navigate, select, and manage content, particularly in applications that involve categorization, filtering, or multi-choice options.  

- **Transformativ:** intuitive and user-friendly approach for users to edit or personalize content within a chip.  

- **Multiple:**  providing a straightforward and efficient way for users how users interact with and manage several chips within a user interface. 

- **Movable:** allowing users to customize the positioning of items, categories, or tags within an interface in an intuitive and user-friendly manner. 

- **Placement:** Input chips have the flexibility to be combined with various other elements, offering multiple possible appearances: list that can be scrolled horizontally, inline with the text input cursor in a field, stacked list.

 Interactions such as color changes or animations, provide users with visual feedback, helping them understand the system's response to their actions. For instance, when a user hovers over a button chip and it subtly changes color, this interaction communicates that the button is interactive and ready for activation, enhancing user clarity and engagement.

## Dos and Don'ts: 

- Tagging and Categorization: Do labeling and classifying various items or products across different industries, facilitating easier tracking and organization.

- Label text: Do label text effectively using chips, allowing for organized and structured information management.

- Filtering and Sorting: Do manag and organize various items or data in a structured manner across different applications and industries.

- Overuse: Don`ts overuse chips to ensure a balanced and effective application of the resource in your system or process.

- Unclear Purpose: Don`ts use chips for unclear purposes, as this can lead to inefficiency and confusion within the system.
