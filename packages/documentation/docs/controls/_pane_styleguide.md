Panes are interactive component that enable users to access hidden content or options that are not immediately visible on the screen. These drawers are usually hidden behind a button or icon and can be revealed by clicking on the control element. Panes can be used for organizing complex information, displaying multiple views or sections, collapsible or expandable, but not the solution for limited content, or confusing layout.

1. Left pane 
2. Top, Bottom pane
3. Right pane


## Types
 
- **Floating**: The columns are shown next to each other and can change in size depending on the available space. The main content remains in its position at the top and doesn't move. In the same time up to four pane can be active. 
- **Inline**: They move the main content. The columns are displayed horizontally in a flexible manner but not for top and bottom. The right and the left pane compressed the main body.  

## Options

- **Width**: For the top and bottom panes default 100% available, for the left and right panes is maximum 50% available from the whole screen. For mobile version the panes takes the whole 100% from the screen.
- **Hight**: For the left and right panes default 100% available space, for the top and bottom panes is maximum 50% available from the white space. For mobile always takes 100% from the screen.
- **Title**: On the top left to better organize the panels, the user can use an optional icon that can be shown before the title. when the user collapses the inline pane, the title also becomes smaller and is displayed on the left side.
- **Size**: We have 4 different for classic layout  pixel sizes: 240,320, 360,480, (for mobile is 100%).
- **Percent**: The default screen can be 50 % or the spit screen 32 % from the whole screen.
- **Buttons**: The floating panes the options to close on the right side, and the inline pane user can expand and collapse the pane with the back and forth button. 
- **Borders**: Can be applied to separate different sections or elements within the same pane, otherwise, you can set all panes without a border for a minimalist and smooth visual experience.


## Behaviour 

- **Breakpoints**: When changing breakpoints, panes should not be collapsed or expanded. 
- **Responsive**: Make the usage suitable for desktop version and adjusts its columns according to the  breakpoints, suitable for small and large screens. 
- **Layout**: There are two layouts, one on the left and right pane, the other on the top and bottom pane. If the right and left pane expands, the top and bottom pane will be compressed, the pane is above the main body content.

## States

- **Expand**: One or more columns can be expanded to take up more space, providing a customizable layout based on user preferences or content requirements. 
- **Collapse**: One or more columns can be hidden or collapsed, allowing for a more focused or compact view of the remaining content. Inline pane is collapsible, you can have a mini content, instead of the title and floating pane is closable. 

 
## Dos and Don'ts

- Do use to organize the content when you have a lot. 
- Do use to display different views within the single screen. 
- Do use to expand or collapse the content to hide or reveal specific content.
