## Variants

Our pill variants offer the flexibility to assign various colors, reflecting their purpose, importance, or context. By using different pill variants, we can effectively convey class, status, and levels of significance. However, it's important to note that the custom variant, although suitable for visualizing numerous categories, does not support color specification for hover and active states.

Pill variants:

- **Primary**: For high visual emphasis.
- **State-related variants**: Alarm, critical, warning, success, info and neutral.
- **Custom**: For a customized background and label color.
